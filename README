# Kladoi Compiler tests

This repo contains all the try tests for PLC Lab 6. The main directory contains all the kladoi code. The `ejm-out` dir contains all of Elliot's code. The `jeh-out` dir contains the try output for the two test cases.

## Usage (on a UNIX system)

Please run this command from the directory containing kladoi-compiler.sh:

    ./plc6-tests/run

## Note

Only cases 1-12 are tested by try. Case 0 is the sample provided online and
case 13 is a test of the if-statement from the discussions.
